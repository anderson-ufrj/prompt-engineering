## Target Journals (Priority Order)

### 1. ACM TOCHI (Primary Target)
**ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction**

- **Fit:** Excellent - HCI + AI collaboration + theoretical framework
- **Impact:** Q1, High
- **Format:** 25-40 pages, ACM LaTeX template
- **Review:** Double-blind, 3-4 months
- **Strengths to emphasize:**
  - Cyborg Cognition framework (theoretical contribution)
  - Computational autoethnography (methodological contribution)
  - Design implications for AI tools
- **Folder:** `tochi/`

### 2. Human-Computer Interaction
**Taylor & Francis**

- **Fit:** Very good - values theoretical depth + empirical data
- **Impact:** Q1, High
- **Format:** APA style, no strict page limit
- **Strengths to emphasize:**
  - Extended mind theory connection
  - Longitudinal depth
  - Qualitative-quantitative mixed methods
- **Folder:** `hci/`

### 3. Minds and Machines
**Springer**

- **Fit:** Excellent for philosophical angle
- **Impact:** Q2
- **Format:** Springer LaTeX/Word

## Key Metrics to Highlight

| Metric | Value | Significance |
|--------|-------|--------------|
| Delegation Score | 0.71 | 71% cognitive delegation to AI |
| Model Selection Ratio | 7.59x | Intentional model choice |
| Sessions Analyzed | 802 | Longitudinal depth |
| Messages | 85,000 | Rich interaction data |
| Tool Uses | 27,000 | Granular tool analysis |

## Backup Strategy

If TOCHI rejects:
1. Use reviewer feedback to improve
2. Adapt for Human-Computer Interaction (2-3 weeks)
3. If rejected again, pivot to Minds and Machines (philosophical angle)

---

## Popular Press Strategy (Post-Acceptance)

After academic publication:
1. **MIT Technology Review** - Pitch narrative version
2. **WIRED** - Personal story angle
3. **ACM Interactions** - Bridge academic/practical
