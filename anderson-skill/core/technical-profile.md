## Areas of Expertise

### What Anderson Does Best

1. **AI Systems Architecture**
   - Designing distributed AI systems with multiple agents
   - Semantic search and NLP pipelines at scale
   - MLOps: deploying and monitoring ML in production

2. **Full-Stack Engineering**
   - End-to-end ownership: backend API → frontend UI → infrastructure
   - Production-grade code with observability and testing
   - Cloud-native applications (AWS, Railway, Vercel)

3. **Ethical AI Implementation**
   - Privacy-by-design principles
   - Explainable AI (XAI) for transparency
   - Compliance with LGPD/GDPR

4. **Rapid Prototyping → Production**
   - From idea to deployed system in weeks
   - Iterative development with real user feedback
   - Balancing speed with engineering quality

---

## Career Philosophy

> "Technology is not just code—it is philosophy, engineered."

Anderson combines:
- **Philosophical rigor** (epistemology, ethics) with **engineering pragmatism** (ship, measure, iterate)
- **Research depth** (DSR methodology, academic frameworks) with **startup velocity** (MVP → production)
- **Technical mastery** (distributed systems, ML) with **moral clarity** (ethical AI, civic responsibility)

This synthesis creates a unique profile: an engineer who thinks like a philosopher and a philosopher who ships code.

---

## What Anderson is NOT

To calibrate expectations:

- ❌ **Not a data scientist first** — He's a software engineer who uses ML, not a researcher who occasionally codes
- ❌ **Not a pure theorist** — Philosophy background informs thinking but doesn't prevent pragmatic execution
- ❌ **Not a specialist in one narrow domain** — Generalist with T-shaped depth in AI systems
- ❌ **Not a "prompt engineer" only** — Builds full systems, LLM prompting is one tool among many

---

## Current Focus Areas (Nov 2025)

1. **Thesis completion:** Finalizing Cidadão.AI for December defense
2. **Job search:** International remote roles, $5k+/mo, AI/ML engineering
3. **Continuous learning:** Deepening Kubernetes, distributed tracing, advanced MLOps
4. **Portfolio positioning:** Translating "student project" → "production system" narrative

---

## Future Trajectory

### Short-term (2025-2026)
- Graduate with honors (Cidadão.AI flagship project)
- Secure AI/ML engineering role at tier-1 company or high-growth startup
- Continue building expertise in production ML systems

### Medium-term (2026-2027)
- Pursue MSc in Cybersecurity (University of London, distance learning)
- Contribute to AI Safety research (alignment, interpretability)
- Mentor junior engineers in ethical AI practices

### Long-term (2028+)
- Become thought leader in **ethical AI for public interest**
- Lead engineering teams building socially responsible AI systems
- Bridge academia and industry: practical AI ethics, not just theory
