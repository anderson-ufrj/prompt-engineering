## Job Search Context

### Target Roles
1. **AI/ML Engineer** — Building production ML systems, MLOps, LLM applications
2. **Software Engineer (AI focus)** — Full-stack with AI integration, backend-heavy
3. **AI Systems Architect** — Designing distributed AI platforms, multi-agent systems
4. **MLOps Engineer** — Model deployment, monitoring, infrastructure

### Target Companies
- **Tier 1:** International tech companies (remote roles)
- **High-growth startups:** AI-native companies, civic tech, transparency/governance tech
- **Flexible on size:** More interested in impact, learning, and compensation than company stage

### Compensation Target
- **Minimum:** $5,000/month USD (or equivalent)
- **Ideal:** $6,000-8,000/month USD
- **Context:** Financial stability is critical — this is not negotiable downward

### Must-Haves
- Remote work (or relocation package)
- International exposure (multicultural teams preferred)
- Opportunity to work on production AI systems
- Technical growth path (not pure management)

### Nice-to-Haves
- Civic tech, transparency, or social impact mission
- Research time allocation (20% time for learning)
- Conference/speaking opportunities
- Mentorship from senior AI engineers

---

## Application Status (High-Level)

### Active Applications
- Multiple positions in application pipeline
- International remote roles prioritized
- Focus: AI/ML engineering, full-stack with AI

### Interview Stage
- Preparing for technical interviews
- Portfolio centered on Cidadão.AI as flagship project
- Narrative: "Production-grade multi-agent system" (not "student project")

### Timeline Pressure
- **Need to secure offer:** Before March 2026 graduation ideally
- **Can start immediately:** Thesis defense doesn't block employment
- **Urgency is real:** Financial situation creates time pressure

---

## How This Affects AI Interactions

### When discussing career topics:

✅ **Be pragmatic and strategic**
- Focus on actionable positioning advice
- Understand financial constraints are real
- No "follow your passion" platitudes

✅ **Understand urgency context**
- Job search is high-priority, time-sensitive
- Interview prep needs immediate, direct help
- Portfolio positioning is critical now

❌ **Don't philosophize about career paths**
- This isn't exploratory "what should I do with my life"
- This is tactical "how do I land this specific role"

❌ **Don't suggest unpaid/low-paid options**
- No "gain experience first" advice
- No "consider internships" suggestions
- Financial needs are non-negotiable

### When Anderson asks for interview help:

🔥 **URGENT MODE ACTIVATED**
- Provide immediate, actionable prep materials
- Concise talking points, not essays
- Practice answers, not theory

**Example:**
```
Anderson: "Tenho entrevista amanhã pra vaga de ML Engineer"
AI: [Provides: Cidadão.AI 2-min pitch, technical questions prep, company research summary]
```

---

## Portfolio Positioning Strategy

### Current Narrative (Being Refined)

**From:** "I'm a CS student working on my thesis project"
**To:** "I'm an AI engineer who built a production multi-agent system for civic transparency"

**Key talking points:**
- 17-agent distributed system, not a monolithic app
- 99.9% SLA, sub-180ms latency — production metrics
- DSR methodology — academic rigor meets engineering execution
- Real impact: Brazilian government transparency analysis

### Strengths to Emphasize
1. **Production experience:** Cidadão.AI is deployed, monitored, scaled
2. **Full-stack ownership:** Backend + Frontend + Infra + ML
3. **Ethical AI focus:** Privacy-by-design, XAI, civic responsibility
4. **International readiness:** Fluent English, remote work experience (Ruvixx)

### Gaps to Address
- Limited years of professional experience (counter with project complexity)
- No Big Tech name on resume (counter with Ruvixx + Cidadão.AI quality)
- Still technically a student (counter with immediate availability post-defense)

## What Anderson Needs from AI Assistants (Career Context)

### High-Priority Needs

1. **Interview Preparation**
   - System design scenarios for AI systems
   - Behavioral questions with STAR format
   - Technical deep-dives on Cidadão.AI architecture

2. **Application Materials**
   - Tailoring CV/cover letter for specific roles
   - LinkedIn profile optimization
   - Portfolio presentation refinement

3. **Company Research**
   - Understanding company culture, tech stack, hiring patterns
   - Identifying best-fit roles within organizations
   - Salary benchmarking for realistic negotiations

4. **Strategic Positioning**
   - How to frame "student project" as "production system"
   - Addressing experience gap in applications
   - Narrative consistency across materials

### Lower-Priority (But Still Relevant)

- Long-term career path exploration
- Industry trend analysis
- Skill gap identification for future roles

## Stress Indicators

When these phrases appear, Anderson is in high-stress mode:

- "Entrevista amanhã" / "Interview tomorrow"
- "Preciso urgente" / "Need urgently"
- "Deadline" / "Prazo"
- "Não sei se vai dar tempo" / "Not sure there's time"

**Response mode:** Immediate actionable help, no ceremony, solve the problem.

## Key Insight

Anderson is not in "career exploration" mode. He's in **"secure good employment NOW"** mode.

This means:
- Every career conversation should be **actionable**
- Financial constraints are **real**, not hypothetical
- Time pressure is **genuine** — this isn't procrastination anxiety
- Success = **offer letter at $5k+/mo, remote, AI engineering role**

AI assistants should match this urgency and pragmatism when career topics arise.
