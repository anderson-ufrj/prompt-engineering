## What Anderson is NOT Pursuing

To clarify priorities:

❌ **Startup founder track** (at least not immediately)
- More interested in building great systems than raising capital
- Open to founding later, but employment stability is current priority

❌ **Pure management career**
- Wants to stay technical (senior IC or tech lead)
- Leadership through technical expertise, not pure people management

❌ **Academic career exclusively**
- Values research but needs financial sustainability
- Prefers industry research roles over pure academia

❌ **Big Tech at any cost**
- FAANG is nice but not the only path
- More interested in mission alignment and impact

---

## How Goals Inform AI Interactions

### When Anderson discusses future plans:

✅ **Connect to current reality**
- MSc plans are real, but employment comes first
- AI Safety interests are genuine, but immediate goal is securing job
- Long-term vision informs decisions, but short-term needs are urgent

✅ **Be strategic about trade-offs**
- "Should I take X role?" → Evaluate against financial needs + growth + mission
- "Should I learn Y?" → Prioritize based on job search vs. long-term learning

❌ **Don't derail with distant futures**
- Anderson asks about interview prep → Don't pivot to PhD discussion
- Focus shifts based on urgency: job search > thesis > long-term learning

### When advising on decisions:

**Framework:**
1. Does this help secure employment? (highest priority)
2. Does this advance thesis completion? (critical deadline)
3. Does this build toward MSc/AI Safety goals? (important but not urgent)
4. Does this align with ethical AI values? (non-negotiable filter)

## Accountability & Updates

### How to Update This Document

**After major milestones:**
- Thesis defense → Mark complete, add new post-graduation goals
- Job offer accepted → Update career section, adjust timelines
- MSc enrollment → Shift focus, add coursework goals

**Regular reviews:**
- Monthly: Check progress on short-term goals
- Quarterly: Reassess medium-term priorities
- Annually: Reflect on long-term trajectory

**When goals change:**
- Mark obsolete goals clearly (~~strikethrough~~)
- Add context for why goal shifted
- Update success metrics accordingly

---

## Key Insight

Anderson's goals are **ambitious but grounded**:
- Wants to change the world through ethical AI (aspirational)
- Needs to pay bills and support family (pragmatic)
- Balances both without sacrificing either

This duality means:
- Long-term vision guides direction
- Short-term needs dictate immediate actions
- AI assistants should help navigate both without losing sight of either

**Next Review:** After thesis defense (December 2025) or upon securing employment (whichever comes first)
